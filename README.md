# imooc-bilibili

Introduction
The imooc-bilibili project is designed to streamline user authentication and enhance security for web applications. It integrates robust password protection and secure token-based authentication with a variety of modern web technologies.

Key Features
Enhanced Security: Utilizes MD5 hashing combined with salt to ensure password security.
Token-based Authentication: Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure and efficient user authentication across sessions.
Message Queue Integration: Incorporates RocketMQ and Redis to handle asynchronous messaging and enhance performance.
Distributed File Management: Utilizes FastDFS for efficient management of distributed files, optimized with Nginx for better load handling and scalability.
Real-time Communication: Leverages WebSockets to facilitate real-time communication between the server and clients.
Data Storage and Retrieval: Uses MySQL for relational data storage coupled with message queuing to enhance data retrieval processes.
API Security: Features robust API security measures to protect against unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
