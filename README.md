# imooc-bilibili

## Introduction
The imooc-bilibili project is designed to streamline user authentication and enhance security for web applications, incorporating robust password protection and secure token-based authentication with modern web technologies.

## Key Features
- **Enhanced Security**: Uses MD5 hashing with salt to ensure password security.
- **Token-based Authentication**: Implements JWT for secure and efficient user session management.
- **Message Queue Integration**: Integrates RocketMQ and Redis for asynchronous messaging and performance enhancement.
- **Distributed File Management**: Employs FastDFS optimized with Nginx for efficient file management and scalability.
- **Real-time Communication**: Leverages WebSockets for real-time server-client communication.
- **Data Storage and Retrieval**: Utilizes MySQL coupled with message queuing for improved data retrieval processes.
- **API Security**: Ensures robust security measures to protect APIs from unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
